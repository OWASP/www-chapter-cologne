## Welcome
The OWASP Cologne Chapter is an open and inclusive community focused on application security. For several years, we have gathered as a Stammtisch, meeting regularly to discuss security topics, share knowledge, and connect with others interested in software security. Now, as an official OWASP chapter, we continue this tradition while expanding our discussions and engagement within the local security community.

Cologne has a thriving tech scene, with a strong mix of startups, established companies, and research institutions. Our chapter provides a welcoming space for developers, security professionals, students, and researchers to exchange knowledge, stay updated on security trends, and strengthen application security practices.

We meet on the third Thursday of every second month (the exact dates are below), at [Startplatz](https://www.startplatz.de/) in Köln.  

## Get Involved

OWASP is open to everyone, regardless of background or experience level. You can:

* Attend our meetups to participate in discussions and learn about application security.

* Share your knowledge by giving a talk or presenting on a topic.

* Help grow the chapter by contributing ideas or assisting in organizing events.

## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. 

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate. We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert.
